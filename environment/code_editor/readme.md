# Code Editor

## Overview

Information from here is sourced from the [Picotron Manual](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/picotron_manual.html)

The code editor is open on boot in the first workspace, defaulting to `/ram/cart/main.lua`.

Like all of the standard tools, it runs in a tabbed workspace, where each tab is a separate process editing a single file.

## Sections

[Keybinds](keybinds/main.md)

[Text Editor](text_editor/main.md)

## Opening

To open or create a file in the editor from terminal:

```lua
> code foo.lua
```
