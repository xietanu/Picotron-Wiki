# Recording gifs

## Overview

You can record gifs natively in Picotron through `CTRL+8` and `CTRL+9` or through use of the `capture.p64` system app.

## Recording a gif

### Starting a recording

To start capturing a gif, you can press `CTRL+8`, this will begin recording the selected area.

### Ending a recording

The gif will automatically end recording at a certain point.

### Settings a recording area

To set the area that is captured, you can press `CTRL+SHIFT+8` to select an area to record.

This defaults to the full visible area in Picotron if you don't use `CTRL+SHIFT+8`.

### Missing information

The amount of time that the gif records is variable (see `/system`), the details as of writing this are unknown.

Details on using the capture app to record is missing.
