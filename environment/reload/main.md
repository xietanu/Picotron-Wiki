# Reloading a cartridge

## Overview

You can reload the currently loaded cartridge through the full cart or only one file.

This only applies to the cartridge in `/ram/cart` and works in exports.

## Full reloading

`CTRL+R` fully reloads the currently loaded cartridge

## Live reloading

`CTRL+SHIFT+R` live-reloads a single .lua or .gfx file while the cartridge is running
