# Screenshots

## Overview

There are two forms of screenshots in Picotron, cart labels and generic `.png` screenshots.

## Generic `.png` screenshots

Generic screenshots can be captured through pressing `CTRL+6`.
This is created in the `png` format.

These screenshots are automatically appended to `{Your Host OS desktop}/picotron_desktop`.

## Cart labels

Cart labels are generated through pressing `CTRL+7`.
This generates a label for the currently loaded cart (in `/ram/cart`) in the `.qoi` format.
