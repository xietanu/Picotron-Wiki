# SFX Editor

## Overview

Information from here is sourced from the [Picotron Manual](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/picotron_manual.html)

The map editor is open on boot in the first workspace, defaulting to `/ram/cart/sfx/0.sfx`. Like all of the standard tools, it runs in a tabbed workspace, where each tab is a separate process editing a single file.

The SFX editor can be used to create instruments, sound effects (SFX), and music (SFX arranged into "patterns").

Each of these has their own editing mode that can be switched between by pressing TAB, or by clicking on the relevant navigator header on the left. Instruments can also be edited by CTRL-clicking on them, and SFX and pattern items always jump to their editing modes when clicked.
