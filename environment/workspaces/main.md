# Workspaces

## Overview

Workspaces are different spaces for work, e.g: the code editor or gfx editor.

Fullscreen or tabbed apps have their own workspace.

The desktop is the default workspace and is where windowed apps are placed by default.

## Changing Workspaces

Changing workspaces can be done by clicking the respective workspace icon in the top right.

This can alternatively be done with `ALT+LEFT` and `ALT+RIGHT` where the active workspace cycles left and right respectively.

By pressing `ESCAPE`, you can switch between the current workspace and either: the terminal or a fullscreen process that has been opened. The fullscreen process takes presedence over the terminal.
