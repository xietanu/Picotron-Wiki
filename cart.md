## To Do / Issues

You cannot click links

Text wrapping is based on characters rather than words

Text wrapping doesn't seem to be using the full width that is given

Some markdown formatting isn't correct (I think this comes from the pod db treating the md codeblock headers as real headers, seen in `documenting.md`)

Custom themes:

* Colors
* Fonts

Settings that let you change the database source (from the astralsparv github repo to another, on the off chance this is abandoned)

There's no variation between headers, they are all lilwide.
