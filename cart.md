## Features!

Go through the *entire* wiki through the database.

Includes basic markdown support

Allows you to copy paste code snippets from codeblocks

Codeblocks are auto-syntaxed

Clickable hyperlinks

Ability to open hyperlinks & pages in the host os by middle clicking (or CTRL clicking) them!


## To Do / Issues

Some markdown formatting isn't correct (I think this comes from the pod db treating the md codeblock headers as real headers, seen in `documenting.md`)

Custom themes:

* Colors
* Fonts

There's no variation between headers, they are all lilwide.

No scrollbar & no max scroll
