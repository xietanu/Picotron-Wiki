# Desktop Customisation

## Overview

This guide is sourced from the [Picotron Manual](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/picotron_manual.html).

This goes over customising your Picotron Desktop.

## Settings

The Picotron settings can be opened via the Picotron menu (top left) or by accessed by typing "settings" in the terminal.

Within the settings, you can customise your desktop, e.g: changing the theme, wallpapers or screensavers.

## Themes

There are some default themes packaged within Picotron, these are located in `/system/themes/`.

These themes change the color palette of Picotron.

You can add custom themes by creating a folder at `/appdata/system/themes/` and creating `.theme` files in that folder.

These themes will then be accessible through the Settings.

## Wallpapers
There are some default wallpapers packaged within Picotron, these are located in `/system/wallpapers/`.


These wallpapers change the backdrop of the desktop. Each wallpaper is a `.p64` cartridge.

You can add custom wallpapers by creating a folder at `/appdata/system/wallpapers/` and placing `.p64` cartridges in that folder.

These wallpapers will then be accessible through the Settings.

## Screensavers

There are some default screensavers packaged within Picotron, these are located in `/system/screensavers/`.

These screensavers change the backdrop of the desktop. Each screensaver is a `.p64` cartridge.

You can add custom screensavers by creating a folder at `/appdata/system/screensavers/` and placing `.p64` cartridges in that folder.

These screensavers will then be accessible through the Settings.

## Widgets

Widgets are programs that run in the slide-out tooltray (pull the toolbar down from the top), and are windowed programs that are not moveable and do not have a frame. To install a widget, first run it as a windowed program, adjust the window size to your liking (if it resizeable),  and then drag and drop it into the tooltray. The widget will now be re-launched every time  Picotron boots.
Running BBS apps can be installed directly in the tooltray -- there is no need  to make a local copy first.

Right-click a widget to pop in back out as a window, or to remove it.
