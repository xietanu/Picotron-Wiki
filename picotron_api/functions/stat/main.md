# function stat(n,[...])

## Overview

Greatly helped by [@akd-io and @Maxine](https://github.com/akd-io/picotron/blob/ccb6d34d8594cd4c2d45930cf8723c241f5aa6e9/drive/projects/stat/stats.md?plain=1#L80)
Returns information about the system and can sometimes do actions such as garbage collection.

## Arguments

### n: `number`

The id for the information you want to fetch

### [...]: `arbritrary`

Arbritrary arguments, sometimes used in stat, e.g: with `stat(302,keycode)`

### Valid usage

Where the first number is `n` and any other arguments, if present, are `[...]`

`Unknown` signifies that it returns values, but what they mean is unknown.

@Astralsparv's [Picotron Logger Distribution](https://github.com/Astralsparv/Picotron-Logger-Distribution) will be updated to help document this, fed the arbritrary values seen in unknown stats and detecting any change in the stat per frame in hopes of finding a cause and reproducing it.

#### Stats

* 984 - Unknown
* 985 - Unknown
* 987 - miliseconds picotron has been running

## Returns

The queried information from the stat, unique to `n`, see the valid stats above for information on specific stats.

## Unknown stats

More information on unknown stats.

[stat.lua](https://github.com/akd-io/picotron/blob/main/drive/projects/stat/stat.lua) (a test from akd-io)

### 308

Observed value `1973.0` and `2334.0` in stat.lua output.

No code references.

### 309

Observed value `60531740.0` and `63912031.0` in stat.lua output.

No code references.

### 310

Observed value `551.0`, `565.0` and `3689.0` in stat.lua output.

Same decompiled code as for stat(311) below, but passing 2 to pdisk_count_slots_by_kind() instead of 0.

No code references.

### 311

Functionality unknown.

Observed value `15833.0`, `15819.0` and `12342.0` in stat.lua output.

Decompiled code by Maxine:

```C
if (stat_type != UNDOCUMENTED_311) goto LAB_00460c7f;
tmp_int0 = pdisk_count_slots_by_kind(0);
result_num = (lua_Number)tmp_int0;
```

#### Picotron Manual reference
Each process in Picotron has a limit of 32MB RAM, which includes both allocations for Lua objects, and data stored directly in RAM using memory functions like poke() and memcpy(). In the latter case, 4k pages are allocated when a page is written, and can not be deallocated during the process lifetime.

Only 16MB of ram is addressable: 0x000000..0xffffff. Memory addresses below 0x80000 and above 0xf00000 are mostly reserved for system use, but anything in the 0x80000..0xefffff range can be safely used for arbitrary purposes.

### 313

Amount of memory allocated

Decompiled by Maxine
```C
    case UNDOCUMENTED_313:
        lua_pushnumber(L, cproc->mem_highwater);
        return 1;
```

### 984

To do with yielding and coroutines

Code reference: 
```lua
if costatus(c) == "suspended" and stat(984) == 0 then
```
### 985

Observed value `1.0` in stat.lua output.

### 988

To do with minimal terminal setup

Code reference:
```lua
-- give a guaranteed short window to skip
if (stat(988) > 0) bypass = true _signal(35)
```
