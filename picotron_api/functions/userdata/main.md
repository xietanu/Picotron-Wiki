# userdata(type, width, [height], [data]): ud
## Overview
The userdata function is one of two ways to create a new userdata from scratch, with the other being the [vec](picotron_api/functions/vec/main.md) function.
Produces a new [userdata](/picotron_api/userdata/readme.md) with a specified type and size.

## Arguments
### `type`: "u8"|"i16"|"i32"|"i64"|"f64"

The type of number that the userdata will contain.
- "u8" is an unsigned 8-bit integer
- "i16" is a signed 16-bit integer
- "i32" is a signed 32-bit integer
- "i64" is a signed 64-bit integer
- "f64" is a 64-bit floating point number

### `width`: number

The number of columns in the produced userdata. Will be floored. If less than 1, causes the returned value to be nil.

### `[height]`: number
The number of rows in the produced userdata. Will be floored. If less than 1, causes the returned value to be nil. When excluded, the userdata will have one row, but will not have an internal height value, which can affect the behavior of some userdata methods.

### `[data]`: string
The values to initialize the userdata with. Defaults to setting every entry to 0.

If the userdata is an integer type, `data` must be formatted as a contiguous 0-padded hexidecimal string. For instance, if `type` is `i16`, the string `"000F2001"` would produce the numbers (in decimal) 15 and 8,193 for indices 0 and 1.

If the userdata is a floating point type, `data` must be formatted as a comma-separated list of decimal values. For instance, `"0.1,0.5,12"`.

## Returns
### `ud`: [userdata](/picotron_api/userdata/readme.md)|nil
The userdata produced, or nil if `width` or `height` is less than 1.

## Example
```lua
local ud = userdata("u8", 2, 2, "080D1522")

?ud:get(0, 0) -- 8
?ud:get(1, 0) -- 13
?ud:get(0, 1) -- 21
?ud:get(1, 1) -- 34
```
