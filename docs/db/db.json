                  "This is not an envelope, but works in a similar way. Right clicking on an envelope button (to the right of the knob's numeric field) when no envelope is assigned toggles random mode. When this mode is active, a pink R is shown in that spot, and a random value within the knob's range is used every time the instrument is triggered. This can be used to produce chaotic unexpected sounds that change wildly on every playthrough, or subtle variation to things like drum hits and plucks for a more natural sound."
